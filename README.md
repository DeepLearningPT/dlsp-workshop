# Workshop outline

At the moment we have three confirmed sessions.

## Workshop 1

* Explaining the problem
* Outlining the solution by deep mind
* First code example (reading the data from the disk)

## Workshop 2

* Creating the dataset class
* Creating the model class

## Workshop 3

* Training loop
* 30 minutes left to cover delays.


# Coding roadmap

* TODO reading the dataset from disk
* TODO Creating the dataset class
  - Converting raw numpy arrays to graphs;
  - Merge reading from disk with graph creation in a torch geometric
    class.
* TODO Creating the model class
* TODO Creating the training loop
